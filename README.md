PassCore is a web application that stores and protect all your password on the websites you visit and use on daily basis. You don't have to store passwords on your heads again. PassCore has a built-in Password generator you can use on your website. All you have to do is create an account, log in and create a tab for the website, add the website link, and add the password you used on the website below. Now you can access the password whenever you forget or want to log into the website.![Image 05-08-2022 at 01 22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72390202/182978258-3cb25a95-1058-47dd-beae-437585d93c5a.JPG)
